## Sort Numbers
In the file `task1.cpp` you're given a function `sortNumbers()` that sorts an array of integers in an ascending order.

The sorting algorithm seems to be fine but there's something wrong with the given implementation so it doesn't produce the right output.

Your task is to find a bug and fix it. 

### Example Input
You can change input numbers to sort in `numbers` initialization
```
int numbers[] = {17, -7, 221, 12, 0, 0, -4, 13};
```
### Example Output
The correct output for the given input would be then
```
-7 -4 0 0 12 13 17 221
```
